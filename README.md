# ecan
events community ambassador network

Made by an Events Hacker in Residence for herself and other Hackers in Residence!
An automated outreach tool that makes contacting potential speakers for campus tech talks as easy as sending one e-mail.
After initial e-mail, ecan will send a follow up e-mail every few days. The template sent will change depending on whether the lead has responded or not. The template sent also updates company docs on the status of the lead. 

If a response is given, the automation stops but you can still choose from premade templates to continue the conversation and edit them as you will.
